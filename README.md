# 小狗品种分类(卷积神经网络） - Dog Breed Classifier

This is the 2nd project in the course of Deep Learning at Udacity

The project implemented the famous **AlexNet**(including Convolutional Layers and fully connnected Layers) from scratch 

The project also implemented **transfer learning** with **Pytorch** to take advantage of pre-trained **VGG16** model to identify dog breeds
