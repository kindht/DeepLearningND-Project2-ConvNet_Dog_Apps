This is the 2nd project for the **Deep Learning** Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://cn.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101-cn-advanced)

The project built a CNN model from scratch to implement typical **AlexNet** architecture (including 5 Convolutional Layers and 3 fully connnected Layers, as well as some Maxpooling Layers and Dropout layers)

The project also implemented **Transfer learning** using **Pytorch** to take advantage of pre-trained **VGG16** model to identify dog breeds. 

In the project, dataset was preprocessed using torchvision.transforms for **data augamentation**.  OpenCV is used for human faces detection. 

The algorithms implemented in this project can be used for mobile apps or web apps.
